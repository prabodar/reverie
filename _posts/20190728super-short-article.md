GPT2 is the 2nd most downloaded model on the Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Hub. It's a boon when text generation capabilities are needed, but... it was released in 2019. Naturally, it underperforms when knowledge of recent events is beneficial.

What if I told you there is a drop-in replacement? 

Thanks to the Online Language Modelling project being developed at Hugging Face ðŸ¤—, we will periodically release GPT2 (and RoBERTa) models trained on up-to-date data. Same architecture and model size, but (hopefully) a better understanding of the modern world.

This means that if you have a project using GPT2, I highly recommend trying our OLM models! Have a look at the resources in the comments.

Your data can tell you a lot about the type of ML you could do, the type of hardware you should invest in and the people you should hire. Here is a simple guide:

Text Data (build chatbots for customer service, â€¦):
- Lots of data: can make use of Deep Learning. A robust data engineering infrastructure around the data should be designed. Modeling requires highly specialized people in the domain. GPU machines should increase modeling speed
- Small amount of data: Should probably explore first pre-trained DL models. Engineering infrastructure is less important. Modeling could be performed by a less specialized workforce. GPU machines may not be necessary

Image Data (face recognition for security systems, augmented reality systems, ...):
- Lots of data: DL will probably generate performance beyond anything traditional techniques could produce. A robust data engineering infrastructure around the data should be designed. Modeling requires highly specialized people. GPU machines are a must.
- Small amounts of data: Pre-trained DL Models could yield satisfactory results but should possibly question investing in ML in general for Computer Vision applications. Engineering infrastructure around the data is less important. Modeling could be performed by a less specialized workforce. GPU machines remain important for improved modeling speed.

Time Series Data (sales forecast, stock price prediction, ...):
- Lots of data: Traditional methods like XGBoost will generally yield greater performance in time series data. A robust data engineering infrastructure around the data should be designed. Modeling could be performed by generalist data scientists. GPU (for Transformers or LSTM for example) and CPU machines could be leveraged.
- Small amounts of data: It is potentially not a problem to be solved with ML techniques. Engineering infrastructure around the data is less important. Modeling could be performed by a less specialized workforce. GPU machines are most likely unnecessary.

Tabular Data (product recommendation, customer churn prediction, ...):
- Lots of data: traditional ML techniques usually outperform Deep Learning. However, in the case of recommendation engines with very sparse variables, DL has proven to bring superior performance. A robust data engineering infrastructure around the data should be designed. Modeling could be performed by generalist data scientists. GPU may not be very useful as Deep Learning is less relevant in this case (apart from in the case of Rec Engines).
- Small amount of data: It is probably not a problem to be solved with ML. Should possibly reconsider investing in advanced analytics. A robust data engineering infrastructure around the data is less important. Modeling could be performed by a less specialized workforce. GPU machines are most likely unnecessary.
