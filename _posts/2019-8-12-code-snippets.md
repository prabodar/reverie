This post demonstrate the use of code snippets in the theme. The code snippets are powered by [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) and the code theme that is been used in Reverie is called [Draula](https://draculatheme.com/).

This is a raw snippet:

```
hello world
123
This is a text snippet
```

This is a PHP snippet:

```php
<?php
    echo 'Hello, World!';
?>
```

This is a JavaScript snippet:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
const minus = (a, b) => a - b

console.log(add(100,200))  // 300
console.log(minus(100,200))  // -100
```

This is a Python snippet:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("hello world!")

say_hello()   // "hello world!"
```

GPT2 is the 2nd most downloaded model on the Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Hub. It's a boon when text generation capabilities are needed, but... it was released in 2019. Naturally, it underperforms when knowledge of recent events is beneficial.

What if I told you there is a drop-in replacement? 

Thanks to the Online Language Modelling project being developed at Hugging Face ðŸ¤—, we will periodically release GPT2 (and RoBERTa) models trained on up-to-date data. Same architecture and model size, but (hopefully) a better understanding of the modern world.

This means that if you have a project using GPT2, I highly recommend trying our OLM models! Have a look at the resources in the comments.
