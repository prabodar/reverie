I am a research scientist with a background in language modeling, NLP, transfer learning, deep/machine learning, data analysis, statistical analysis, and 6+ years of experience in data processing/collection, and the application of transfer learning, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms to solve various research problems. I have been involved in several European and industrial projects and am currently supervising PhD, MSc, MPhil, and bachelor students. I am passionate about recent transformer-based language models and researching ways to optimize language models to reduce inference time and using multilingual language models for various NLP tasks.
